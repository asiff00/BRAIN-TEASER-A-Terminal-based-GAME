# BRAIN-TEASER-A-Terminal-based-GAME
Improve your computational power. 

How it works:
Two random generated integer will appear in the screen in a form of A+-B, You have to input the solution.There are rewards for correct input, more than two wrong input will terminate the game.
The range of A and B and the rewards will increase over time.

It is a fun project, maybe silly, absolutely is! But it does a real deal. It can help you with your computational power. 


YOU ARE WELCOME TO PLAY!
